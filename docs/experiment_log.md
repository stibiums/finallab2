# Overcooked MARL Experiment Log

Date: 2026-06-20

Project path: `/Volumes/share/pku/26_spring/多智能体/finallab2`

## Goal

This log records the current Overcooked multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments. The main question is whether a simple PPO baseline on the `simple` map learns a usable cooperative policy, and what its main weaknesses are under reward ablation, partner changes, and zero-shot layout changes.

## Environment

- Conda environment: `overcooked-marl`
- Algorithm: PPO from Stable-Baselines3
- Environment wrapper: PantheonRL simultaneous-agent interface around Overcooked-AI
- Main training map: `simple`
- Horizon: 400
- Evaluation: 20 deterministic episodes unless noted
- Primary metric: soups delivered, computed as sparse reward / 20

## Run Summary

| Run | Seed | Timesteps | Train seconds | Mean soups | Mean sparse reward | Mean episode reward | Demo soups |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `baseline_simple` | 10 | 200000 | 80.13 | 7.50 | 150.0 | 285.40 | 7.0 |
| `no_shaping_simple` | 10 | 200000 | 79.38 | 0.00 | 0.0 | 0.00 | 0.0 |
| `distance_shaping_simple` | 10 | 200000 | 80.57 | 7.50 | 150.0 | 285.40 | 7.0 |
| `baseline_seed11` | 11 | 200000 | 86.07 | 7.85 | 157.0 | 289.75 | - |
| `baseline_seed12` | 12 | 200000 | 87.21 | 10.30 | 206.0 | 385.15 | - |
| `partner_diversity_simple` | 20 | 200000 | 70.77 | 7.30 | 146.0 | 277.10 | 8.0 |

## Step 1: Reward-Shaping Ablation

| Run | Shaping setting | Mean soups | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `no_shaping_simple` | all shaping rewards disabled | 0.00 | Pure sparse reward is too hard at this training budget. The agents do not discover soup delivery. |
| `baseline_simple` | default shaping | 7.50 | Default shaping solves the basic `simple` layout reasonably well. |
| `distance_shaping_simple` | default shaping plus small distance rewards | 7.50 | Extra distance rewards did not improve final sparse performance over the default baseline. |

Conclusion: reward shaping is necessary for this short local training regime, but the tested distance shaping does not add measurable improvement.

## Step 2: Partner-Diversity Experiment

Fixed partner pool:

- `baseline_simple`
- `baseline_seed11`
- `baseline_seed12`

Evaluation matrix on `simple`:

| Ego | Partner | Mean soups | Mean sparse reward | Status |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `baseline_simple` | `baseline_simple` | 7.50 | 150.0 | ok |
| `baseline_simple` | `baseline_seed11` | 5.60 | 112.0 | ok |
| `baseline_simple` | `baseline_seed12` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok |
| `partner_diversity_simple` | `baseline_simple` | 7.30 | 146.0 | ok |
| `partner_diversity_simple` | `baseline_seed11` | 6.50 | 130.0 | ok |
| `partner_diversity_simple` | `baseline_seed12` | 0.05 | 1.0 | ok |

Conclusion: partner-diversity training slightly improves compatibility with `baseline_seed11`, but it does not solve compatibility with the much stronger/different `baseline_seed12` partner. It also slightly lowers performance with the original baseline partner.

## Step 3: Zero-Shot Layout Generalization

Baseline ego with baseline partner:

| Layout | Mean soups | Mean sparse reward | Status | Error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `simple` | 7.50 | 150.0 | ok | |
| `simple_tomato` | - | - | error | `KeyError: 'tomato'` |
| `small_corridor` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `random0` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `random1` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `unident_s` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |

Partner-diversity ego with baseline partner:

| Layout | Mean soups | Mean sparse reward | Status | Error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `simple` | 7.30 | 146.0 | ok | |
| `simple_tomato` | - | - | error | `KeyError: 'tomato'` |
| `small_corridor` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `random0` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `random1` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |
| `unident_s` | 0.00 | 0.0 | ok | |

Conclusion: neither policy generalizes zero-shot beyond the training layout. The `simple_tomato` failure is not a learned-policy failure; it is an environment-stack limitation where the current Overcooked-AI featurizer used by this wrapper raises `KeyError: 'tomato'`.

## Current Findings

1. The local machine can run 200k-step PPO experiments in about 70-90 seconds per run, so it is enough for short experiments and debugging.
2. The baseline is valid on `simple`: about 7.5 soups per 400-step episode.
3. Sparse-only learning fails at this budget, confirming the need for shaped rewards.
4. The tested distance shaping does not beat the default shaping.
5. Single-partner training overfits partner style. A baseline ego fails with `baseline_seed12` even though `baseline_seed12` itself is a strong self-play run.
6. Partner-diversity training helps a little against one alternate partner, but not enough to be considered a robust solution.
7. Cross-layout transfer is essentially zero; a curriculum or multi-layout training regime is needed next.

## Next Experiments

The next project direction should move beyond re-running this baseline:

1. Multi-layout curriculum: train on `simple`, `small_corridor`, `random0`, `random1` instead of only evaluating zero-shot.
2. Stronger partner-diversity: include held-out partner seeds and evaluate against them, not only against training partners.
3. Tomato support decision: either avoid tomato maps in this environment stack or patch/replace the featurizer before using tomato layouts.
4. Report framing: use default shaping baseline as the reliable baseline, then present sparse reward failure, partner overfitting, and zero-shot failure as motivation for curriculum and robust partner training.
